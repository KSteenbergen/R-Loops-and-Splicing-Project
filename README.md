# R-Loops and Splicing in Ewing Sarcoma
These two reports were completed for the R-loops and Splcing project.  This project assessed the transcriptomic changes in Ewing sarcoma cells treated with a splicing inhibitor.  
This repository includes the most current final reports for the Differential Gene Analysis and for the Differential Transcript Usage Analysis.
`DESeq2` was used for identifying differential genes, and `DRIMSeq` and `DEXSeq` were used to assess transcript useage.  Data visualization utilized `ggplot2`, `pheatmap`, `EnhancedVolcano`, `enrichplot` and `plotly`.  Pathway Enrichment and Over-representation analysis utilized `msigdbr`, and `enrichR`.
