# R-Loops and Splicing in Ewing Sarcoma
These two reports were completed for the R-loops and Splcing project.  This repository includes the most current final reports for the Differential Gene Analysis and for the Differential Transcript Usage Analysis.
DESeq2 was used for identifying differential genes, and DRIMSeq and DEXSeq were used to assess transcript useage.
